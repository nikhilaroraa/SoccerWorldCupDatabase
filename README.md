# Soccer World Cup Database

This program employs fundamental programming concepts to manage teams as structures, each
uniquely identified by a team code, name, group seeding, and primary kit color. Operating with an array of structures accommodating
up to 32 teams, the program offers commands for inserting, searching, updating, and printing the entire list of soccer teams
participating in the World Cup. Users are guided through inputting team details, with robust error handling ensuring data validity. The
program facilitates seamless interaction with the soccer team database, allowing for easy exploration and manipulation of team
information. It's a user-friendly tool designed for the dynamic world of the Soccer World Cup, enabling efficient data management
without the need for data preservation across program runs.
