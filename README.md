# Soccer World Cup Database

The "Soccer World Cup Database" is a C-based program that employs fundamental programming concepts to manage teams as structures, each uniquely identified by a team code, name, group seeding, and primary kit colour. Operating with an array of structures accommodating up to 32 teams, the program ensures a seamless interaction with the soccer team database, allowing for easy exploration and manipulation of team information. Users are guided through inputting team details, with robust error handling ensuring data validity. This program is structured into separate files, with "worldcupDB.c" orchestrating the overall flow and two additional files, "worldcup_team.h" and "worldcup_player.h," containing specific structures and functions for teams and players.

The main file, "worldcupDB.c," is a user-friendly interface that prompts viewers to input operation codes for various tasks related to teams and players. It offers commands for inserting, searching, updating, and printing the entire list of soccer teams participating in the World Cup. The program also manages player data, with functions for inserting, searching, updating, and printing player details. This versatile and modular design ensures efficient data management without needing data preservation across program runs. The "2211 World Cup Database" is a powerful and user-friendly tool designed for the dynamic world of the Soccer World Cup, providing a comprehensive solution for organizing and maintaining World Cup-related data.
